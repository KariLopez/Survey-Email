            Hello Karina,<br>
            <br>
            We’re sorry you decided not to attend our school this year. Every situation is different and we’d like to hear your thoughts about why you decided to enroll your child somewhere else. <br>
            It helps us provide better information and services at our school for next year.  By answering this short 1 question survey we can get a better idea about how we can improve. <br>
            We appreciate your input.<br>
        </p>
